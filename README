FinishInFour is a web platform that enables students, faculty, and advisors to chart course plans and ensure students are on track to graduate from their university in four years or less. Our initial case, San Jose State University (SJSU), has a 4-year graduation rate at 30%. That rate doubles when considering a fifth year. SJSU administration has implemented policy after policy to lower this number, yet the graduation rates seldom change. This project helps students chart college courses in a user-friendly way by providing visual, color-enhanced feedback to help design their pathways to fit the four-year track. Stakeholders include the administration, who benefit from the churn of students, allowing them to admit more, upper-division professors whose classes fill up with students taking extra courses to fill their extra semesters, and students who see a financial and temporal incentive to graduating on time. The application domain is the educational sector, initially focusing on students at SJSU, and eventually scaling to include other universities following proof of concept within SJSU.
